It was very late in the discotheque
I was feeling blue as I sometimes do
I turned around it was time to go
A face in the crowd a face I didn't know
We got to talking for a little while
You said it's not the sort of thing you usually do
Talking to strangers so late in the night
These days you never know
Well I thought you were nice I even told you so
But you smiled so shyly and said to me
I bet you say that to all the girls you meet
But it isn't so
Yes, the club was closing so we had to leave
We walked out together just a little ill at ease
I would have liked to have walked you home
But you said you'd catch the bus so I ended up alone
I never knew your name nor your telephone number
Will I ever see you again? I wonder?
It wasn't any longer than an hour or two
That lonely street I said goodbye to you
You glanced back at me as I turned the corner
Was the last I saw of you
Oh I wanted to call, call out your name
But stupid pride and idiot shame
Hesitated, scared of playing the fool
So you walked away, from Mr Cool
I never knew your name nor your telephone number
Will I ever see you again? I wonder?
No, I never knew your name nor your telephone number
Will I see you again? Oh girl I wonder?
It was very late in the discotheque
I was feeling blue as I sometimes do
I thought you were nice I told you so
But I ended up alone
No, I never knew your name nor your telephone number
Will I ever see you again? Girl, I wonder?
It's so very late in the discotheque and I'm feeling blue
As I always do
I turn around 'cause its time to go`

Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming!
Rumbling, Rumbling!
Beware!
Coming for you!
All I ever wanted to do was do right things
I never wanted to be the king, I swear
All I ever wanted to do was save your life
I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear
I'm tearless, I'm fearless
I'm burning, I'm burning
You tell me what have I missed?
Still wandering in the deep mist
If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to die another day
I don't want anything, I'm just here to...
Beware!
All I ever wanted to do was know what's out there?
I refused to lose without a fight, oh, oh-yeah
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
We're just too young, ignorant and innocent
Like kids stay up all night in a tent, oh yeah
How do you see me? Oh yeah
Am I who I used to be?
Beware!
Nobody knows what's inside of me
Nobody knows what's inside of me
Nobody knows what's inside of me
Ah
If I lose it all, slip and fall
Will you laugh at me?
If I lose it all, lose it all
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to die another day
I don't want anything, I'm just here to...
Beware!
Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming!
Rumbling, Rumbling!
Coming for you!
Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming!
Rumbling, Rumbling!

var HELLO = `
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Anymore (lows, lows, lows, lows)
Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
